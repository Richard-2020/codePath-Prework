Required Functionality
The following required functionality is complete:

 Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
 "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
 Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
 Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
 Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
 User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
 User loses the game after an incorrect guess
The following optional features are implemented:

 Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
 Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
 More than 4 functional game buttons
 Playback speeds up on each turn
 Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
 Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
 Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
 Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
 User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn
The following additional features are implemented:

 List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

Reflection Questions
If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. I didnt use any outside resource. I onlly used my prior coding knwledge.

What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) I encountered problems with my audio implementation. I couldn't get it to work for some reason even after debugging.

What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) I would like to learn more about css. Its knowlendge would help me in my path of app development.

If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) I would spend more time on the game logic. I felt as though i needed more time to implement and at the same time add on top of the logic that was provided. I would implement sequences mimicing a song just for fun, if the song beat is recognized by the user, the user will do better. I would also add levels of difficulty creating longer songs. Monitoringthe users response time would also be a goood implementation.
